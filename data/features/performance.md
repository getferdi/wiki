Ferdi, at its core, is a Chrome-based browser. Due to this, having many services open at the same time can impact your performance and can cause Ferdi to use a lot of system resources.

To help with performance issues we advice you to activate "Service Hibernation". Hibernation will unload services that you havn't used for a while an reload them as soon as you come back to them.

To activate hibernation, open Ferdi's settings using the cog in the bottom left corner and activate "Enable service hibernation". Additionally you can select after what timeframe services should be unloaded via the "Hibernation strategy" option.
